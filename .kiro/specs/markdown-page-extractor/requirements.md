# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a cross-browser extension (Manifest V3) that extracts the main content from web pages and converts it to Markdown format. The extension will provide users with a simple way to capture clean, readable content from any webpage by clicking a browser action button, which will automatically extract the content, convert it to Markdown, and copy it to the clipboard.

The extension will support both Firefox and Chrome-based browsers, using Readability.js for content extraction and Turndown.js for HTML-to-Markdown conversion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Browser Extension Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Manifest V3 browser extension with proper configuration, so that it can be installed and run on both Firefox and Chrome-based browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest.json file is created THEN the extension SHALL use Manifest V3 format
2. WHEN configuring for Firefox THEN the extension SHALL include a valid UUID in the `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` field surrounded by curly braces
3. WHEN the extension is loaded THEN it SHALL be compatible with both Firefox and Chrome-based browsers
4. WHEN the manifest is validated THEN it SHALL include all required fields (name, version, manifest_version, description)

### Requirement 2: Library Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Readability.js and Turndown.js libraries into the extension, so that I can extract and convert page content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN it SHALL include Readability.js library (version 0.6.0)
2. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN it SHALL include Turndown.js library (version 7.2.1)
3. WHEN the manifest is configured THEN it SHALL properly reference both libraries for use in content scripts or background scripts
4. WHEN the libraries are loaded THEN they SHALL be accessible to the extension's scripts

### Requirement 3: Browser Action Button

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click a browser action button, so that I can trigger the content extraction and conversion process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN a browser action button SHALL appear in the browser toolbar
2. WHEN the user clicks the browser action button THEN the extension SHALL trigger the content extraction process
3. WHEN the button is displayed THEN it SHALL have an appropriate icon and tooltip
4. WHEN the extraction is in progress THEN the user SHALL receive visual feedback

### Requirement 4: Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to extract the main content from the current page, so that I get clean, readable content without ads and navigation elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers the extraction THEN the extension SHALL use Readability.js to parse the current page
2. WHEN Readability.js processes the page THEN it SHALL extract the main article content
3. WHEN the content is extracted THEN it SHALL exclude navigation, ads, sidebars, and other non-essential elements
4. IF the page has no extractable content THEN the extension SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN extraction completes THEN the extracted HTML content SHALL be passed to the conversion process

### Requirement 5: Markdown Conversion

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extracted HTML content to be converted to Markdown format, so that I can use it in Markdown-compatible applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML content is extracted THEN the extension SHALL use Turndown.js to convert it to Markdown
2. WHEN the conversion completes THEN the output SHALL be valid Markdown syntax
3. WHEN converting THEN the extension SHALL preserve important formatting (headings, lists, links, emphasis)
4. WHEN converting THEN the extension SHALL handle images, code blocks, and tables appropriately
5. IF conversion fails THEN the extension SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 6: Clipboard Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Markdown content to be automatically copied to my clipboard, so that I can easily paste it into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Markdown conversion completes THEN the extension SHALL copy the result to the clipboard
2. WHEN the content is copied THEN the user SHALL be able to paste it immediately
3. WHEN the copy operation completes THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation feedback
4. IF the clipboard operation fails THEN the extension SHALL notify the user with an error message

### Requirement 7: Permissions and Security

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to request only necessary permissions, so that users trust the extension and it follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest is configured THEN it SHALL request only the minimum required permissions
2. WHEN the extension needs to access page content THEN it SHALL request appropriate host permissions or use activeTab permission
3. WHEN the extension needs clipboard access THEN it SHALL request clipboardWrite permission
4. WHEN the extension accesses page content THEN it SHALL do so securely without exposing user data

### Requirement 8: Code Formatting Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project files to follow consistent formatting standards defined in .editorconfig, so that the codebase maintains consistency and readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or modifying project files THEN they SHALL respect the .editorconfig settings
2. WHEN working with JavaScript files THEN they SHALL use tab indentation as specified in .editorconfig
3. WHEN working with JSON files THEN they SHALL use tab indentation as specified in .editorconfig
4. WHEN working with files in the lib/ directory THEN they SHALL be excluded from .editorconfig formatting requirements (pre-bundled libraries)
5. WHEN creating new files THEN they SHALL use UTF-8 charset and LF line endings
6. WHEN saving files THEN they SHALL have a final newline and trimmed trailing whitespace

### Requirement 9: Version Control Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each implementation step to be committed with appropriate commit messages, so that the development history is clear and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is completed THEN the changes SHALL be committed to version control
2. WHEN committing changes THEN the commit message SHALL clearly describe what was implemented
3. WHEN reviewing history THEN each commit SHALL represent a logical unit of work
4. WHEN commits are made THEN they SHALL follow conventional commit message format
